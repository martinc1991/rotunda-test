# rotunda-test

In this repo you'll find two JS exercises solved by me:

1. Zoo exercise
2. URLparser

Although you can watch the code directly from here (not so many lines), I would recommend to run the project from your PC to see the testing work.

## Dependencies

- NodeJS ([how to install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1US-P13yKVs))
- JestJS ([official website](https://jestjs.io/))

## How to run the project

First, clone this repo in a folder of your preference _(let's call it 'localfolder'):_

```shell
# /localfolder
git clone https://github.com/martinc1991/rotunda-test.git
```

> That will download all the files from the repo to your PC.

Next, you should go to the root folder of the project and run `npm install`:

```shell
# /localfolder
cd rotunda
# /localfolder/rotunda
npm install
```

Finally, to run the test, in that root folder (or any folder within) run the command `npm test`:

```shell
# /localfolder/rotunda (or any folder)
npm test
```

Then the test will run and after a few seconds you should see a message telling you that all the test passed.

> Feel free to modify the exercises and the test if you want!
